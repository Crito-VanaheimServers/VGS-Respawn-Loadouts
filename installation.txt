!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!! VGS Loadouts was built around ExtDB3 if you want it to work for ExtDB2			  !!!
!!! it will be up to you to edit your database.ini file to get it to work for ExtDB2. !!!
!!!																					  !!!	
!!! VGS Loadouts Does Not work with Stokes Magee respawn script, it is possible  	  !!!		
!!!	to get it working but requires some code rearrangement that I will not share  	  !!!
!!!	due to it being a paid script.													  !!!
!!!																					  !!!	
!!! VGS Loadouts works with or without XSSpawn.										  !!!		
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Database Setup:

	At the root of this package you will find the database.sql file.
	Take this file and run it in your database.
	This will add a new column at the end of account table called vgs_Loadout.

	Inside @ExileServer folder provided in this package you will find sql_custom folder.
	Go into the sql_custom folder and open the exile.ini file with a text editor.
	Copy the contents of this file and paste them at the bottom of your database .ini file.
	
Server Side Files Setup:
	
	Inside @ExileServer folder provided in this package you will find addons folder.
	Go into the addons folder and copy the vgs_Respawn_Loadouts.pbo.
	paste the vgs_Respawn_Loadouts.pbo into your servers @ExileServer\addons directory
	
Mission File Setup:

	Inside the mpmissions folder provided in this package you will find mission.map folder
	Go into the mission.map folder.
	
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	Inside the custom folder provided you will find haloparachute folder.
	This is only necessary if halo jump when spawning in is used so players
	do not lose backpacks when they land on the ground. If you use EXAD's haloparachute
	already or any other script that puts backpacks back onto player after a halo jump 
	than this file is NOT to be used.
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	
	You will need to unpbo your mission pbo for your server and if you do not have a custom
	folder in the unpbo mission file than you will need to copy the custom folder provided
	with this package into it. 
	
	If you already have a custom folder than you will copy the contents of custom 
	folder provided in this package into your custom folder for your mission.
	
	Now with these neeeded files in your mission file you will want to go into the
	custom folder and find the folder called vgs_Respawn_Loadouts and inside this folder
	you should find config.sqf, edit this file to your liking.
	
	Find your config.cpp file within your mission and search for 
	class CfgExileCustomCode

	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	It is important that you know if you use XSSpawn or not.
	It is also important to pay attention to what files you currently have
	set for overrides in this CfgExileCustomCode and if these following files
	are overriden already than you need to either remove them from CfgExileCustomCode
	or go and compare the differences of my provided overrides with those and get them
	working. I used the most current verstion XSSpawn so its code is already merged with
	my code therfore if you or anyone else has not added to xsspawn code on your server than
	you should just remove the correct line from CfgExileCustomCode and use my override leaving
	all other xs spawn overrides.
	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	
	if you use XSSpawn than Inside the braces for class CfgExileCustomCode you will neeed to add the following:

		ExileServer_object_player_createBambi = "custom\vgs_Respawn_Loadouts\overrides\xsSpawn\ExileServer_object_player_createBambi.sqf";

	if you DO NOT use XSSpawn than Inside the braces for class CfgExileCustomCode you will neeed to add the following:

		ExileClient_gui_selectSpawnLocation_event_onSpawnButtonClick = "custom\vgs_Respawn_Loadouts\overrides\no_xsSpawn\ExileClient_gui_selectSpawnLocation_event_onSpawnButtonClick.sqf";
 
	Save the file you are done with it.
	
	Find your description.ext file within your mission and add the following:
	
		#include "custom\vgs_Respawn_Loadouts\GUI\defines.hpp"
		#include "custom\vgs_Respawn_Loadouts\GUI\dialog.hpp"

	Still in the description.ext file search for class CfgFunctions
	
	If you have a class CfgFunctions already then in the braces for the class CfgFunctions
	add the following paying attention to the comments put above class ExAd:
	
		#include "custom\vgs_Respawn_Loadouts\CfgFunctions.cpp"
		
		//the next five lines of code are only needed if your using the provided haloparachute files from this package!!!!!
		class ExAd
		{
			tag = "ExAd";
			#include "custom\haloparachute\CfgFunctions.cpp"
		};

	If you DO NOT have a class CfgFunctions already in your description.ext then
	at the bottom of your description.ext add the following paying attention to the 
	comments put above class ExAd:

		class CfgFunctions
		{
			#include "custom\vgs_Respawn_Loadouts\CfgFunctions.cpp"
				
			//the next five lines of code are only needed if your using the provided haloparachute files from this package!!!!!
			class ExAd
			{
				tag = "ExAd";
				#include "custom\haloparachute\CfgFunctions.cpp"
			};
		};

	Still in the description.ext file search for class CfgNetworkMessages
	
	If you have a class CfgNetworkMessages already then in the braces for the class CfgNetworkMessages
	add the following:

		#include "custom\vgs_Respawn_Loadouts\CfgNetworkMessages.cpp"

	If you DO NOT have a class CfgNetworkMessages already in your description.ext then
	at the bottom of your description.ext add the following:

		class CfgNetworkMessages
		{
			#include "custom\vgs_Respawn_Loadouts\CfgNetworkMessages.cpp"
		};

	Save the file you are done with it.

	Find your initPlayerLocal.sqf file within your mission and add the following:

		[]execVM "custom\vgs_Respawn_Loadouts\init.sqf";

	Save the file you are done with it.

	You are done with the your mission and can now pbo it back up!

	If you use infistar you will need to add the 99102 to allowedIDDs otherwise the menu will not work
	for non admin players and they will not be able to respawn.

	Enjoy.
